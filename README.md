# Consumer Nails — Website Package

This folder contains a ready-to-publish static website for **Consumer Nails**.
To preview locally, open `index.html` in a browser.

## Publish to GitHub Pages (simple steps)

1. Create a new **public** GitHub repository (e.g. `consumer-nails-site`).
2. Upload all files from this package to the repository root (keep the same folders: `assets`, `images`, etc.).
3. In the repository settings -> Pages, choose the `main` branch (or `gh-pages`) and the root folder `/` as the source.
4. Save — your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute or two.

I included your booking link and Instagram. To add or replace images later, upload new files into the `/images` folder and add an `<img>` tag in `gallery.html`, or replace existing photo files (named photo1, photo2...).

**Files included:**
- index.html
- services.html
- gallery.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/main.js
- images/ (your uploaded photos)

If you'd like, I can also create the GitHub repository for you (I'll need GitHub access), or give exact commands to deploy via Git CLI.
